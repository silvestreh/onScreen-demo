# OnScreen Demos

[OnScreen](https://github.com/silvestreh/onScreen) is a light library that does stuff when the matched elements enter or leave the viewport. Tested to work in IE9+, Edge, Gecko, Blink, and Webkit.

This repository holds a few demo projects which will hopefully point you in the right direction to use OnScreen.

These demos are public domain. Do what you will with them.
